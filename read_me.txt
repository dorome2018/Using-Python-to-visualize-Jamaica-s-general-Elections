This is the documentation of the steps that I had taken up to the current stage of the project

downloaded the dataset from http://ecj.com.jm/elections/election-results/parliamentary-elections/
	The document was in the form of PDF hence we need to change it to a CSV
		This is a format that is easily used by data science
	Downloaded a open source software to to convert PDF data table to CSV
		https://tabula.technology/
#Some of the documents that where in a PDF format that can not be converted by tabula
	Assumption:
		maybe have to do mannually
		or go back to the government agency to determine if they have a better format
#Now I mannual compare the PDF and CSV datatables to check for missing details on the CSV files
	I will use Excel for this today however in the future I may use Python
		my hope is to do everything in python
#I just will used a Jupyter notebook for the documentation 
	I can do my in regards to documentation format and structure
